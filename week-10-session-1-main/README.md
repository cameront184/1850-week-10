# Scripting examples

## Python stubs

The exercises today are in the form of stubs.

Choose which ones you want to complete.

Read the guidance inside the file.

If necessary look up the API or module for documentation.

Test your work using appropriate files, either from the testdir/ folder or create your own.  

## Testing data

The testdir/ folder contains a mixture of text data, compressed files and subfolder.

Use it as test data for your scripts.

## Documentation

Many of the examples require you to look up documentation on modules and APIs.

Python documentation starts from: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
